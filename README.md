## prerequisite
>Intial setup in master branch

## Intro To Directive
Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.

A directive must belong to an NgModule in order for it to be usable by another directive, component, or application. To specify that a directive is a member of an NgModule, you should list it in the declarations field of that NgModule.

There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
1. Components—directives with a template (no html).
2. Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. Those were looking into priviously. (eg *ng-if, *ng-for)
3. Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. (eg [ngClass])
